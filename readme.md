Text games in 2021? You bet! Quite honestly, this game might become GUI based. I just have to learn how to program a bit better. But expect to have savegames, weapons, (possibly) even a universal currency that changes LIVE across all users. Hopefully will run over Tor.

### compiling
Requirements

Debian|Linux: GCC/G++

Windows: Not compilable on Windows (yet!)

Also note: This is designed to ONLY run on Linux! Windows builds will arrive at some point.
